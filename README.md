# RTracy server
This is server for streaming .utacy files generated by https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/byond-tracy to tracy https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy profiler

Works with Tracy 0.13.1 (protocol 77)

This server allow partial streaming of large snapshots to prevent huge memory usage

# Usage
Just run rtracy with .utracy file as arg and connect using capture or tracy

Server support multiple connection at the same time

Optional arguments
| Arg | Info |
| --- | ------------- |
| -p port | Port on wich server will be run  |
| -s skip | Skip desired amount of frames from snapshot begin |
| -l limit | Limit desired amount of frames to be streamed |

For example if you want to stream 30 minutes of data after 10 minutes from start (assuming you snapshot written at 10 frames per second) run ./rtracy you_file.utracy -s 6000 -l 18000

# Why
RTracy created to resolve two main problems of @AffectedArc07 ParaTracyReplay script (https://github.com/AffectedArc07/ParaTracyReplay): 
1. Query handling while loading, wich allow you to stop load snapshot at any time without getting ??? on all callsights
2. Partial file streaming wich allow to open 100GB snapshots without 128GB of ram

Also this server slightly faster
